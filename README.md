# vsc-kube - Distributed VScode in Kubernetes

*vsc-kube* is a project that aims to provide easy in-browser VSCode workspaces creation and management.

The project is still in *can it be done?* state, and most likely will not work until first alpha is released.

The project is using awesome [cdr/code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) as a foundation for the VSCode workspaces.
